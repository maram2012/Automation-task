Douglas Task

I have designed a test automation framework using testNg framework, MAVEN project and Page Object design. And I have covered following 3 scenarios as per mentioned in the task:→

1- As an user with correct credentials I would like to be able to login to
the webshop

2- As a user I would like to receive an error message, if I enter wrong
credentials.

3- As a user, I would like to be able to reset my password if I forget my
credentials.

To run the script, open the project and click right on the tests Package  and select run as
testng suite.

If you need to check the test report check test-output folder open “index.html” with
web browser, you will find testing report is generated.
